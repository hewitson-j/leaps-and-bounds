          "To provide each child with a healthy and happy Pre-K experience in a warm and loving Christian home environment and to ignite his/her excitement for future learning; to build self esteem, self confidence and self reliance. My approach to teaching is hands-on and play-based. Learning styles vary. I believe the best approach to learning is through all of the senses. I promote problem solving, positive social skills and communication every day. My curriculum includes studies of interest to the Pre-K child and I work hard to present these studies as well as necessary kindergarten and life skills in a meaningful way."

          "I am passionate about teaching preschool! I have been working in the field of early childhood education for almost 20 years beginning in high school. I am a member of NAEYC, CAEYC and am licensed with the state of Colorado. After 10 years of working in the public school system in Nevada I moved to Colorado Springs and began working at a childcare center and did so for over two years. At that time, I decided to open my own preschool classroom. I have been teaching preschool-age students in my home as a licensed family childcare provider for over five years. My husband and I have been married 9 years. We have a beautifully blended family with six children whose ages range from 17- 25. We have one dog named Rosie and a cat named Ophelia. I enjoy being able to teach children from my home. I love working with them and seeing their faces light up when they learn something new! Iâ€™m excited to have your child join our class and look forward to teaching, as well as learning from them. I truly believe each child has amazing potential and gifts already inside of them. Thank you for considering becoming a part of the Leaps & Bounds Preschool family!"
